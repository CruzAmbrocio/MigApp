The PMDB, a massive centrist party, has always been an awkward partner for Ms Rousseff's left-wing Workers' Party (PT), which needs its votes but shares little of its ideology.  The PMDB currently has seven ministers and 69 of the 513 members of the lower house of Congress, where the president is struggling to come up with the one-third vote she needs to block impeachment.  The impeachment case, currently before a congressional committee tasked with making a recommendation to the full lower house, is built on accusations that Ms Rousseff manipulated the government's accounts to boost public spending and hide the severity of the recession.  The Brazilian bar association filed a new impeachment request Monday, seeking to expand the case to include accusations of obstructing justice in the investigation into a multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal at state oil company Petrobras.  Since the beginning of March, millions of Brazilians - especially whites, the wealthier and better-educated - have marched to demand Ms Rousseff's removal.",
